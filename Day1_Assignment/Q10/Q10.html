        /*What is hoisting?
        The JavaScript engine before parses the code before executing and during the parsing
        phase it shifts all the variabledeclaration to the top of the scope.
        This behavior of the JS engine is called hoisting.*/

        /*Variables defined with var are hoisted to the top and can be initialized at any time.
        Meaning: You can use the variable before it is declared:*/
